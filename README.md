Executive Summary
---
BICC is one of the largest polycarbonate manufacturers in the world. As a leading commodity chemical corporation, we must set the industry standard in profitability, efficiency, and environmental impact. Currently, our processes rely heavily on the use of phosgene to produce polycarbonates. Phosgene is a toxic chemical with a threshold limit of 0.1 parts per million, and it causes direct harm to humans and ecosystems that come into contact with it. To avoid the dangers of phosgene, we have designed a greener alternative process based on the production of dimethyl carbonate (DMC). This route is promising because DMC is non-toxic and can be made from cheap, easily accessible raw materials at high production rates.  # Non_Phosgene_DMC_Production_Plant
